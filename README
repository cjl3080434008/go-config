The Makefile and configfile_test.py are to be used only
if you want to place this package in the standard library.

To place this package in the standard library and run
the test cases do:
mkdir $GOROOT/src/pkg/configfile/
cp configfile.go configfile_test.go Makefile $GOROOT/src/pkg/configfile/
cd $GOROOT/src/pkg/configfile/
make
gotest configfile_test.go
(and you should see PASS).

Otherwise, to use it separately from the standard library
just do as usual:
6g configfile.go
... and then link to your own source file.
